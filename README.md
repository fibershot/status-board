# status-board
Small node.js/express/socket.io project which allows displaying status messages in real-time from any web browser. In developement for a very specific situtation.

## Information
Made with JavaScript and HTML.
Modules include node, express and socket.io.

Use **node index.js** in a terminal to start the server locally. Default port 1337 (so cool I know (changeable)).
Access server in a web browser using **{address}:1337**.
As of now, commands are used client-side within ~~the web browser~~ a new terminal window using any console of your liking with **node client.js**.

Not really much to see as of now. Thanks.
