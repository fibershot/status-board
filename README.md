# status-board
Small node.js/express/socket.io project which allows displaying status messages in real-time from any web browser. In developement for a very specific situtation.

## Information
Made with JavaScript and HTML. ESM base (not CommonJS).
Modules include [node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node), [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io) and [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).

Use **node index.js** in a terminal to start the server locally and with **(e.g) node index.js 8080** you can choose your own port. Default port 1337 (so cool I know).
Access server in a web browser using **{address}:1337**.
As of now, commands are used client-side within ~~the web browser~~ a new terminal window using any console of your liking with **node client.js** (if you use a custom port, remember to address it!).

Not really much to see as of now. Thanks.
